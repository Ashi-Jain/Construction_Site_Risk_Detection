## About Project

An application that helps to detect the different types of risks that are associated with the construction workers while working at the sites. The app sends the image that is being uploaded by the user to the server where it is analysed using SSD (Single Short Detector) model. Once the backend is done, the detected image is displayed to the user with the bounding boxes and its respective confidence scores.
